        <h2>Hawke’s Bay brothers dominate NZ pinball champs, next stop worlds</h2>
        <img src="Images/T&J pin.jpg" alt="Josh and Tyler Dipper"class="image">
        <p> Teenage brothers Josh and Tyler Dipper from Hastings have made waves in New Zealand’s competitive pinball scene by dominating the recent New Zealand Pinball Championships in Auckland. The pair faced off in the national finals, with 17-year-old Tyler ultimately defeating his 18-year-old brother Josh to claim the 2024 national title. This achievement not only highlights their individual skill, but also marks a rare moment in the country’s competitive history: two siblings securing both finalist positions in an IFPA-sanctioned national event.</p>

        <p>   The championship victory is particularly significant given the structure of the New Zealand Championship Series, overseen by the International Flipper Pinball Association (IFPA). Players accumulate points across numerous events throughout the year, and only the top contenders are invited to compete in the national finals. Both Josh and Tyler had consistent performances across the season, culminating in their standout finish at the championship.</p>

        <p>   Their success on the national stage has now earned them the opportunity to represent New Zealand at the World Pinball Championships, set to take place in Austria in June 2025. The brothers are already preparing for this next level of competition, where they’ll face off against the world’s best players. This milestone reflects not only their talent but also the rising standard of pinball in regions like Hawke’s Bay, which has produced a number of high-ranking players in recent years.</p>

        <p>   Their achievement also signals a generational shift in the sport. While pinball has traditionally been dominated by older players, Josh and Tyler; still in their teens,are part of a growing movement of younger competitors making their mark internationally. Their journey through the competitive circuit showcases the viability of New Zealand’s pinball development system and the potential for local players to succeed on the global stage.</p>
